WebGL projects

I will collect my WebGL projects and realated notes here. I'm a little upset for not getting the WebGL intern opportunity, but this told me that I still have a long way to go in this field.

##1. Auto-rotating cube

This is the intern interview question I've done. I think I get it right, but I
shall go back to this question late on after I gained more knowledge about WebGL. 

The program is based on [osgjs](http://osgjs.org/) and is quite simple - a cube with updating callback function to make it rotate.

A little demo here:
